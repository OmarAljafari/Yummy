# Restaurant management system:
This is a fully dynamic website there are two websites the first for the client and the second for the admin, from the admin website you can edit anything on the client's website
for example you can add items to the menu or edit or delete.
I used two templates from Bootstrap and I edited them to fit with the project.
I used ASP.NET version 6, code first, Entity Framework, authentication for admin website,
many design patterns like MVC, Repository, MVVM
